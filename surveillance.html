        Surveillance security technologies are used in real-time monitoring and protection of people, property, and assets. They can be classified into three types: Wide and Medium area surveillance, which make use of cameras, radar, and satellite imagery to monitor large areas; small area surveillance, which uses cameras, sensors, and software to monitor small areas; and personal surveillance, which uses GPS tracking, wearable devices, and biometric identification to monitor individuals. These technologies are critical for a variety of applications, including border security, critical infrastructure protection, and disaster response, where they provide real-time situational awareness, detect potential threats, and aid in search and rescue operations. The integration of advanced software allows the data collected by these technologies to be evaluated in real-time, providing users with alerts and notifications from all the various surveillance equipment they have access.
<h5> WIDE AREA SURVEILLANCE</h5>
Wide Area Surveillance (WAS) is a technology that uses cameras, radar, and satellite imagery to monitor and secure large areas, providing real-time situational awareness and detecting potential threats. These  Advanced software are also used to integrate data and provide alerts and notifications to security personnel. WAS is used to aid in search and rescue efforts in border security, critical infrastructure protection, and disaster response. These technologies are commonly found in industrial and agricultural areas.
<h6>For farmland: </h6>
<li> Drones: Use aerial drones to monitor large areas of farmland for potential threats such as crop theft or damage.</li>
<li> tracking: Track the location of farm vehicles and equipment to prevent theft or misuse.</li>
<li> monitoring: Use sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and other environmental factors to optimize crop yield.</li>
<li>Animal tracking: Use tracking devices to monitor the location and behaviour of livestock for optimal management.</li>
<h6>For industrial areas: </h6>
<li> cameras: Monitor high-risk areas such as loading docks, parking lots, and storage facilities to prevent theft and vandalism.</li>
<li>Video analytic: Use advanced software to analyse video footage and identify suspicious behaviour such as loitering or unauthorized entry.</li>
<li>Perimeter security: Use cameras, sensors, and access control systems to monitor and secure the perimeter of the property.</li>
<h5>MEDIUM AREA SURVEILLANCE</h5>
Medium Area Surveillance (MAS) is a security device that detects and tracks humans, vehicles, and other things within a defined area using various technologies such as cameras, sensors, radar, and software. These technologies are incorporated into a complete security system that enables real-time monitoring and decision-making in order to identify, track, and respond to threats before they become serious. MAS systems are used to monitor and identify security threats at public events, airports, water treatment facilities, and power plants, among other places, and have a wide range of applications, including border security, critical infrastructure protection, and event security.
<h6>For malls:</h6>
<li>Surveillance cameras: Monitor high-traffic areas such as entrances, parking lots, and food courts to deter crime and enhance safety.</li>
<li>License plate recognition: Track and record license plate information to identify suspicious vehicles.</li>
<li>Public address system: Make announcements to shoppers in case of emergency.</li>
<li>People counting technology: Monitor foot traffic to optimize staffing and marketing efforts.</li>
<h6>For Airport:</h6>
<li>Airport surveillance technologies are crucial for ensuring the safety and security of passengers, aircraft, and airport infrastructure.</li>
<li>Surveillance cameras provide continuous video footage that can be monitored and analysed in real-time by security personnel.</li>
<li>Perimeter intrusion detection systems (PIDS) use a combination of sensors to detect and alert security personnel of any unauthorized access to restricted areas.</li>
<h6>For Power Plants:</h6>
<li>Our power plant surveillance technologies provide real-time situational awareness, detect potential threats, and respond quickly to any security incidents.</li>
<li>Surveillance cameras are strategically installed in key areas of the power plant, such as control rooms, turbine halls, and switch yards, to provide a constant stream of video footage that can be monitored and analysed in real-time.</li>
<li>We provide access control systems that are used to regulate access to restricted areas of the power plant, using biometric identification such as fingerprints or facial recognition to verify the identity of power plant staff and prevent unauthorized access.</li>
<li>The cameras are equipped with advanced features such as facial recognition and license plate identification to help identify potential security threats.</li>
<h6>For Estates:</h6>
<li>Our team of experienced professionals will design a customized security plan that meets your specific needs and budget.</li>
<li>We offer regular maintenance and upgrades to keep your security systems up-to-date and functioning properly.</li>
<li>Our goal is to provide you with peace of mind knowing that your estate is secure and protected.</li>
<li>We offer smart home technology for remote monitoring and control of home security systems.</li>
<h5>SMALL AREA SURVEILLANCE </h5>
Small Area Surveillance (SAS) is a crucial technology used in security systems to monitor and secure specific areas. SAS systems use cameras, sensors, and software to capture visual data, detect motion, sound, and other environmental changes, and integrate the data into a single system. The software analyses the data and provides alerts and notifications to security personnel, and can also generate reports and visualise data in real-time. SAS systems are used in building security, retail security, and traffic monitoring to provide real-time situational awareness and detect potential security threats.
<h6>For homes:</h6>
<li>Our surveillance systems provide an added layer of security, deterring potential burglars and giving home-owners peace of mind.</li>
<li>Home-owners can access their surveillance systems remotely, allowing them to monitor their home even when they're away.</li>
<li>Our surveillance systems can send real-time alerts to home-owner mobile devices when specific events occur, such as a door opening or a motion sensor being triggered.</li>
<li>Our surveillance systems can be customized to meet the specific needs of each home-owner, including the number and type of cameras, motion sensors, and other devices.</li>
<h6>For offices:</h6>
<li>Our surveillance systems provide a comprehensive security solution, protecting against intruders and theft.</li>
<li>Security personnel can monitor the office from a remote location, providing an added layer of protection.</li>
<li>Our surveillance systems can be customized to meet the specific needs of each office, including the number and type of cameras, access control systems, and intrusion detection systems.</li>
<li>Our surveillance systems can be used to monitor employees and ensure that company policies are being followed.</li>
<h6>For shops:</h6>
<li>Our surveillance systems can monitor cash register area and prevent theft and fraud.
<li>Our surveillance systems can send real-time alerts to security personnel when specific events occur, such as a person loitering near an exit or a group of people gathering in a specific area.</li>
<li>Our surveillance systems can be customized to meet the specific needs of each shop, including the number and type of cameras, point-of-sale surveillance systems. </li>
